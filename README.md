# MobWeb_AddCustomerAttribute extension for Magento

A simple extension that adds a new attribute to the customer object in the backend. This new attribute can only be changed in the backend, and is not accesible by the customer through the frontend.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Configuration

Replace **Custom Attribute Title** and **custom_attribute_code** with your desired values accross all files.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
